# User Management 

This section discusses the following main topics: 

- [User Account Creation](#user-account-creation)  
- [Delete a User Account](#delete-a-user-account)
- [Purging](#purging)
- [Launching the Web UI](#launching-the-web-ui)

## User Account Creation

When you create a new user account it creates a _user account configuration file_ with _kubectl configuration_ files. 

### Setting up an Administrator Environment

Before creating user accounts, you need to complete the following steps:

1. Install nctl using the description in the [Nauta User Guide](../../user-guide/README.md).
   
2. Copy the `nauta-admin.config` file to the machine where `nctl` resides.   

- An Administrator will need the `nauta-admin.config` file on their machine (the machine where nctl resides) and it needs to be set in the `kube.config' file.

3. Set up `KUBECONFIG` variable to point to the full path of `nauta-admin.config` to where you copied the file in step 2. 

4. Follow the instructions below (_Creating a User Account_) to create users.

   `export KUBECONFIG=<PATH>/nauta-admin.config`

## Creating a User Account

The following is used to create a Nauta user, not an Administrator. Only the person that performed the original install can complete these steps. SSH access will be required by the installer. Administrators _do not_ have access to complete these steps. 

### Administrator Tasks

1. The Nauta `user create` command sets up a namespace and associated roles for the named user on the cluster. It sets up home directories, named after the username, on the input and output network shares with file-system level access privileges. To create a user, execute the following command:
 
   `nctl user create <username>`

2. This command also creates a configuration file named: '<username>.config' and places this file in the user's home directory. To verify that your new user has been created, execute the following command:

   `nctl user list`

3. This lists all users, including the new user just added, but _does not_ show Administrators. An example is shown below (scroll right to see full contents). 

```
| Name    | Creation date          | Date of last submitted job   |   Number of running jobs |   Number of queued jobs|
|---------+------------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------
| user1   | 2019-03-12 08:30:45 PM | 2019-02-27 07:55:13 PM       |                        1 |                       1|
| user2   | 2019-03-12 09:50:50 PM |                              |                        0 |                       0|
| user3   | 2019-03-12 09:51:31 PM |                              |                        0 |                       0|

```

The above command lists all users, including any new user just added.

### User Tasks

1. As an Administrator, you need to provide '<username>.config' file to the Nauta user. The user _must save_ this file to an appropriate location of their choosing on the machine that is running Nauta; for example, their `home directory` using the following command:
   
   `cp <username>.config ~/`

2. Use the export command to set this variable for the user:

   `export KUBECONFIG=~/<local_user_folder>/<username>.config`

### Limitations

Users with the same name _cannot_ be created directly after being removed. In addition, user names are limited to a 32 character maximum, and there are no special characters except for hyphens. However, all names _must_ start with a letter _not_ a number. You can use a hyphen to join user names, for example: john-doe (see [Troubleshooting](../Troubleshooting/T.md) for more details). 


## Delete a User Account

Only an Administrator can delete user accounts and deleting a user removes that user's account from the Nauta software; therefore, that user _will not_ be able to log in to the system. This will halt and remove all experiments and pods; however, all artifacts related to that user's account, such as the users input and output folders and all data related to past experiments they have submitted remains. 

To remove a user, execute the following command:

 `nctl user delete <user_name>`

This command asks for confirmation. 

`Do you want to continue? [y/N]: press y to confirm deletion.`

The command may take up to 30 seconds to delete the user and you may receive the message: _User is still being deleted_. Check the status of the user in a while. Recheck, as desired.

## Purging

To permanently remove (_Purge_) all artifacts associated with the user and all data related to past experiments submitted by that user (but, _**excluding**_ the contents of the userâ€™s input and output folders): 

`nctl user delete <user_name> -p/--purge`

This command asks for confirmation. 

`Do you want to continue? [y/N]: press y to confirm deletion.`
      
### Limitations	

The Nauta `user delete` command may take up to 30 seconds to delete the user. A new user with the same username _cannot_ be created until after the delete command confirms that the first user with the same name has been deleted (see: [Troubleshooting](../Troubleshooting/T.md) for more details).

## Launching the Web UI 

To review the Resources Dashboard, launch the Web UI from the Command Line Interface (CLI). refer to the [Nauta User Guide](../../user-guide/README.md) for more information.  

Do the following to launch the Web UI:

1. Use the following command:

   `nctl launch webui` 
    
2. Your default Web browser opens and displays the Web UI. For Administrators, the Web UI displays a list experiments and shows the following message:

   `No data for currently signed user. Click here to load all users data.`

The image shows the Nauta Web UI. This UI contains experiment information that can be sorted by name, status, and various dates. Refer to the [Nauta User Guide](../../user-guide/README.md) for detailed Nauta Web UI information.
