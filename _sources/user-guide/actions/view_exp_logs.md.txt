# Viewing Experiment Logs and Results Data 

Each experiment generates logs. This is the information generated during the run of the experiment and saved. If an experiment _did not_ print out data during execution, the logs will be blank.

Separate from logs, the results or output of an experiment can be found by mounting the userâ€™s output folder or output-shared folder. A model file should write to the Nauta output folder in order to save any output files. 

Execute the following command to view logs from a given experiment.

**Syntax:** `nctl experiment logs [options] EXPERIMENT-NAME`

**Example:** `nctl experiment logs mnist-tb`

**Result:** The following result, displays an _example log_ (where mnist-tb is shown in the experiment logs, this indicates the name of the experiment).
