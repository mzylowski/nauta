# Evaluating Experiments with Inference Testing

For guidance on using inference testing to evaluate an experiment, refer to the topics shown below.

* For `nctl predict` command and its subcommands and parameters, refer to [predict Commands](predict.md).

* For a demonstration of how to run batch inference, refer to: [Batch Inference Example](batch_inf_example.md).

* For a demonstration of how to run streaming inference, refer to: [Stream Inference Example](streaming_inference.md).

* For running prediction on OpenVINO Model Server, refer to [Inference Example on OpenVINO Model Server](openvino_inf.md)
